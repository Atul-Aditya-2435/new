This project i have made with reference from Angela yu course <br>
this project helped me clearing my basic concepts of JS<br>
This one is a simple dice game which produces random numbers and the pics of dices <br>
are set in according with the random no. generated. whatever the no's are generated winner is <br>
decided on that basis even no's can be same so game can even be draw. 
Happy Playing.....
